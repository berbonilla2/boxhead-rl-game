## ✨ V4 Improvements

### 1. **Reduced Entropy** (Exploitation vs Exploration)
**V3**: 0.04 (high exploration)  
**V4**: 0.028 (-30%)

**Rationale**:
- V3 explored well and found good strategies
- V4 should exploit those strategies more consistently
- Lower entropy = more deterministic = less variance

### 2. **Increased N-Steps** (Credit Assignment)
**V3**: 16  
**V4**: 20 (+25%)

**Rationale**:
- Longer episodes need better long-term credit assignment
- 872-step episodes benefit from 20-step lookahead
- Helps with consistency in later game

### 3. **Higher Value Coefficient** (Stability)
**V3**: 0.5  
**V4**: 0.7 (+40%)

**Rationale**:
- Stronger value function regularization
- Reduces variance in policy updates
- More stable learning = lower std dev

### 4. **Longer Warmup** (Smoother Start)
**V3**: 20%  
**V4**: 25% (+25%)

**Rationale**:
- More gradual learning prevents early instability
- Better initialization of policy
- Reduces bad episodes early on

### 5. **Lower Gradient Clipping** (Stable Updates)
**V3**: 0.5  
**V4**: 0.3 (-40%)

**Rationale**:
- Smoother policy updates
- Less aggressive changes
- Better for consistent performance

### 6. **Skip Connections** (Architecture)
**V3**: Standard feedforward  
**V4**: Residual connections in layer 3

**Rationale**:
- Better gradient flow
- Easier optimization
- More stable training

### 7. **Increased Dropout** (Regularization)
**V3**: 0.15, 0.12, 0.08  
**V4**: 0.18, 0.15, 0.1 (+20%)

**Rationale**:
- Prevent overfitting
- Better generalization
- Lower variance

### 8. **Aggressive Reward Normalization**
**V3**: clip_reward=10.0  
**V4**: clip_reward=8.0 (-20%)

**Rationale**:
- Prevent reward explosions
- More stable learning signals
- Consistent updates

### 9. **Smoother Reward Shaping**
**Environment Changes**:
- Reduced death penalty: 30 → 25 (-17%)
- Increased completion bonus: 30 → 35 (+17%)
- Smoother distance rewards (gradual transitions)
- Health bonus on completion
- Minimal penalties for mistakes

**Rationale**:
- Encourage survival over kills
- Reduce negative spirals
- Reward good behavior more than punishing bad

### 10. **Better Environment Balance**
- Start with 2 zombies (vs 3)
- Easier enemy speeds (slightly reduced)
- More ammo pickups (2 → 3)
- More starting ammo (60 → 70)
- Increased player speed (2.5 → 2.8)

**Rationale**:
- Slightly easier start
- More consistent episodes
- Focus on learning, not dying
