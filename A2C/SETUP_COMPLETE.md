## 2. ‚úÖ Model Versioning System

### Version Naming Convention
- All models follow the pattern: `boxhead_A2C_v{NUMBER}.zip`
- v1 = Baseline model from original training
- v2+ = Enhanced models with optimizations

### Automatic Version Management
The training script automatically:
- Saves models with the version number specified in `MODEL_VERSION`
- Appends training details to `model_log.txt`
- Saves normalization stats as `vecnormalize_v{VERSION}.pkl`
- Creates timestamped training plots and metrics

---

## 3. ‚úÖ Model Log Created

The `model_log.txt` file contains:

### Log 1 (v1 - Baseline):
- **Architecture**: Default SB3 MlpPolicy (64, 64)
- **Observation Space**: 9 features
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - Learning Rate: 7e-4 (cosine decay)
  - N-steps: 8
  - Gamma: 0.99
  - Entropy: 0.01 (default)
- **Training**: 50 episodes √ó 800 steps = 40,000 timesteps
- **Limitations**: Limited features, no normalization, simple architecture

### Future Logs:
Each new version will automatically append:
- Complete architecture details
- All hyperparameters
- Training configuration
- Evaluation results
- Improvements from previous version
- Observations and next steps

---

## 4. ‚úÖ Feature Engineering & Enhanced Environment

### Original Environment (9 features):
1. Player X position
2. Player Y position
3. Player health
4. Delta X to nearest enemy
5. Delta Y to nearest enemy
6. Distance to nearest enemy
7-9. Unused (zeros)

### Enhanced Environment (25 features):
**[0-4] Player State:**
- X position (normalized)
- Y position (normalized)
- Health (normalized)
- Velocity X (direction)
- Velocity Y (direction)

**[5-10] Nearest Enemy:**

**[19-20] Enemy Counts:**
- Zombie count (normalized)
- Demon count (normalized)

**[21-24] Action History:**

  + LayerNorm after each layer
  + Dropout (0.1, 0.1, 0.05) for regularization

Policy/Value Heads:
  [256, 128] separate networks
```

#### B. Enhanced Hyperparameters
| Parameter | v1 (Baseline) | v2 (Optimized) | Reason |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Learning Rate | 7e-4 | 3e-4 + warmup | Stability |
| N-steps | 8 | 16 | Better credit assignment |
| Gamma | 0.99 | 0.995 | Longer-term planning |
| Entropy | 0.01 | 0.02 | More exploration |
| Episodes | 50 | 100 | More training |
| Steps/Episode | 800 | 1000 | Longer episodes |
| Normalization | None | VecNormalize | Stability |

#### C. Advanced Features
1. **Learning Rate Schedule**: Warmup + Cosine Annealing
2. **Normalization**: VecNormalize for observations and rewards
3. **Callbacks**:
   - Advanced metrics tracking
   - Checkpoint saving (every 10k steps)
   - Best model tracking
   - Evaluation callback (every 5k steps)
4. **Visualization**: Real-time plots of:
   - Episode rewards (with moving average)
   - Episode lengths
   - Training losses (total, value, policy)
   - Learning rate schedule
   - Kills per episode
   - Policy entropy

#### D. Enhanced Reward Shaping
```python
Survival: +0.1 per step
Health-based: +0.15 * (health/100)
Optimal distance: +0.3 (100-200 pixels from enemy)
Kill rewards: +5.0 (demon), +3.0 (zombie)
Hit reward: +0.5
Movement: +0.05
Wall proximity penalty: -0.1
Miss penalty: -0.02
Collision penalty: -0.5
Death penalty: -50
Survival bonus: +20 (completing episode)
```

## üöÄ How to Use

### Train v2 Model (Optimized)
```bash
# Activate virtual environment (if not already active)
gameEnv\Scripts\activate

# Navigate to A2C folder
cd A2C

# Start training
python train_a2c_optimized.py
```

### Train v3+ (Future Versions)
1. Open `train_a2c_optimized.py`
2. Change line 32: `MODEL_VERSION = "v3"`
3. Modify hyperparameters as needed
4. Run: `python train_a2c_optimized.py`

### Monitor Training
- Watch real-time plots during training
- Check console for episode statistics
- Training plots saved to `results/training_v{VERSION}_{timestamp}.png`
- Metrics saved to `results/metrics_v{VERSION}_{timestamp}.csv`

### Load and Use Trained Models
```python
from stable_baselines3 import A2C
from stable_baselines3.common.vec_env import DummyVecEnv, VecNormalize
from enhanced_boxhead_env import EnhancedBoxheadEnv

# Load environment
env = DummyVecEnv([lambda: EnhancedBoxheadEnv()])
env = VecNormalize.load("Models/vecnormalize_v2.pkl", env)

# Load model
model = A2C.load("Models/boxhead_A2C_v2.zip")

# Run
obs = env.reset()
for _ in range(1000):
    action, _ = model.predict(obs, deterministic=True)
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
```

## üîß Customization Tips

### Hyperparameter Tuning:
Edit `train_a2c_optimized.py` around line 255:

```python
# Learning rate
learning_rate=warmup_cosine_lr(3e-4),  # Try: 1e-4, 5e-4

# N-steps (credit assignment)
n_steps=16,  # Try: 8, 32, 64

# Gamma (discount factor)
gamma=0.995,  # Try: 0.99, 0.999

# Entropy (exploration)
ent_coef=0.02,  # Try: 0.01, 0.05, 0.1

# Training duration
EPISODES = 100  # Try: 200, 500
STEPS_PER_EPISODE = 1000  # Try: 1500, 2000
```

### Environment Modifications:
Edit `enhanced_boxhead_env.py`:

```python
# Adjust difficulty
self.zombie_speed = 0.7  # Make faster/slower
self.demon_speed = 0.9
self.enemy_spawn_rate = 0.004

# Modify rewards
reward += 0.1  # Survival
kill_reward = 5.0  # Kills
```

### Network Architecture:
Edit `train_a2c_optimized.py` around line 245:

```python
features_extractor_kwargs=dict(features_dim=256),  # Try: 128, 512
net_arch=dict(pi=[256, 128], vf=[256, 128])  # Try: [512, 256]
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Train v2 Model**: Run the optimized training script
2. **Compare Performance**: Check if v2 improves over v1
3. **Iterate**: Based on results, create v3 with further tweaks
