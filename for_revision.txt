================================================================================
                    1. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PROBLEM FORMULATION
================================================================================

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
-----------------
The Boxhead RL problem is a survival-based reinforcement learning task where an 
intelligent agent must learn to survive as long as possible in a top-down 
shooter game environment while managing limited resources and avoiding/eliminating 
hostile enemies.

PROBLEM CHARACTERISTICS:
------------------------
- **Domain**: Real-time action video game
- **Objective**: Maximize survival time and performance
- **Complexity**: Multi-objective optimization (survival, resource management, combat)
- **Challenge**: Partial observability, dynamic environment, sparse rewards
- **Scale**: Continuous state space, discrete action space

AGENT CAPABILITIES:
------------------
- **Movement**: 4-directional movement (up, down, left, right)
- **Combat**: Shooting with different weapons (pistol, shotgun)
- **Resource Management**: Ammunition collection and conservation
- **Spatial Awareness**: Distance estimation and threat assessment
- **Strategic Planning**: Weapon selection and positioning

ENVIRONMENT DYNAMICS:
--------------------
- **Enemy Types**: Zombies (slow, low health) and Demons (fast, high health)
- **Spawn Mechanics**: Dynamic enemy spawning based on game state
- **Resource System**: Limited ammunition requiring strategic management
- **Health System**: Gradual health decay requiring survival strategies
- **Weapon System**: Multiple weapons with different characteristics

LEARNING CHALLENGES:
-------------------
1. **Credit Assignment**: Determining which actions led to long-term success
2. **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Balancing discovery of new strategies vs using known good ones
3. **Sparse Rewards**: Most actions provide minimal immediate feedback
4. **Temporal Dependencies**: Success depends on sequences of actions over time
5. **Dynamic Difficulty**: Environment complexity increases with performance
6. **Resource Constraints**: Limited ammunition requires efficient action selection

                    2. MARKOV DECISION PROCESS (MDP) DEFINITION
================================================================================

MDP COMPONENTS:
---------------

S (State Space):
----------------
The state space S consists of 42-dimensional continuous observations representing:

[0-7]   POSITION & STATUS (8 features):
        - Player X position (normalized to [0,1])
        - Player Y position (normalized to [0,1])
        - Player facing direction X (unit vector component)
        - Player facing direction Y (unit vector component)
        - Player health ratio (normalized to [0,1])
        - Kill count (soft normalized)
        - Shot accuracy ratio (hits/shots)
        - Total enemy count (zombies + demons)

[8-25]  ENEMY INFORMATION (18 features = 3 enemies × 6 features):
        For each of 3 nearest enemies:
        - Delta X to player (normalized)
        - Delta Y to player (normalized)
        - Distance to player (normalized)
        - Enemy type (zombie +1.0, demon -1.0)
        - Enemy health ratio (normalized to [0,1])
        - Threat level (distance + type weighting)

[26-33] RESOURCES & ITEMS (8 features):
        - Ammo count (normalized)
        - Current weapon = pistol (binary)
        - Current weapon = shotgun (binary)
        - Has shotgun unlocked (binary)
        - Nearest ammo pickup delta X
        - Nearest ammo pickup delta Y
        - Nearest ammo pickup distance
        - Weapon pickup available (binary)

[34-39] MAP TACTICAL (6 features):
        - Distance to left wall (normalized)
        - Distance to right wall (normalized)
        - Distance to top wall (normalized)

[40-41] TEMPORAL (2 features):
        - Last action (t-1)
        - Previous action (t-2)

A (Action Space):
----------------
Discrete action space with 6 possible actions:
- 0: Idle/No action
- 1: Move Up
- 2: Move Down
- 3: Move Left
- 4: Move Right
- 5: Shoot (with current weapon)

P (Transition Probability):
--------------------------
P(s'|s,a) represents the probability of transitioning to state s' given current 
state s and action a. The transition dynamics are:

- **Deterministic Components**: Player movement, weapon mechanics, resource consumption
- **Stochastic Components**: Enemy AI behavior, spawn timing, collision detection
- **Environment Response**: Enemy movement patterns, item spawn locations
- **Physics Simulation**: Collision detection, bullet trajectories, damage calculation

R (Reward Function):
--------------------
The reward function R(s,a,s') provides feedback for state transitions:

POSITIVE REWARDS:
- Survival reward: +0.16 per step (encourages longevity)
- Health bonus: +0.28 × health_ratio (encourages maintaining health)
- Kill rewards: +4.5 (demon), +3.0 (zombie) (encourages combat efficiency)
- Completion bonus: +40 + performance bonuses (encourages reaching episode end)
- Distance rewards: Graduated bonuses based on optimal positioning
- Accuracy bonuses: Rewards for successful hits
- Resource bonuses: Rewards for efficient ammo usage

NEGATIVE REWARDS:
- Death penalty: -22 (discourages fatal mistakes)
- Collision penalty: -0.5 (discourages reckless movement)
- Miss penalty: -0.02 (discourages wasteful shooting)

REWARD DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- **Sparse**: Most rewards are small, major rewards for significant events
- **Balanced**: Survival-focused rather than kill-focused
- **Smooth**: Gradual transitions to avoid reward spikes
- **Multi-objective**: Balances survival, combat, and resource management

γ (Discount Factor):
-------------------
γ = 0.99
- High discount factor emphasizes long-term planning
- Appropriate for episodes lasting 900+ steps
- Balances immediate vs future rewards

T (Episode Termination):
------------------------
Episodes terminate when:
1. Player health ≤ 0 (death)
2. Steps ≥ 1000 (successful completion)
3. Maximum episode length reached

Policy Network (Actor):
- **Input**: 42-dimensional state vector
- **Architecture**: Input(42) → [256, 384, 384+skip, 384] → [384, 192] → 6 actions
- **Activation**: ReLU for hidden layers, Softmax for output
- **Output**: Action probabilities π(a|s)
- **Parameters**: ~1.2M

Value Network (Critic):
- **Input**: Same 42-dimensional state vector
- **Architecture**: Input(42) → [256, 384, 384+skip, 384] → [384, 192] → 1 value
- **Activation**: ReLU for hidden layers, Linear for output
- **Output**: State value V(s)

- **Weight Initialization**: Xavier uniform initialization

TRAINING ALGORITHM:
-------------------

Policy Gradient Update:
∇θ J(θ) = E[∇θ log π(a|s) A(s,a)]

Where:
- J(θ): Policy objective function
- π(a|s): Policy probability of action a given state s
- A(s,a): Advantage function = Q(s,a) - V(s)

Value Function Update:
∇φ J(φ) = E[∇φ (V(s) - V_target)²]

Where:
- V(s): Current value estimate
- V_target: Target value from n-step returns

ADVANTAGE ESTIMATION:
A(s,a) = R_t + γR_{t+1} + ... + γ^{n-1}R_{t+n-1} + γ^n V(s_{t+n}) - V(s_t)

Where:
- n = 24 (n-steps for credit assignment)
- R_t: Reward at time t
- γ = 0.99 (discount factor)

HYPERPARAMETERS (V5 - Final Optimized):
